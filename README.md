This is a resarch project is expanding upon the Cybersecurity Topic Classification tool for online forum discussions, originally created by Elijah Pelofski, Lorie M. Liebrock.
The original research has a critical flaw by using a TF-IDF / Bag of Words vectorization strategy which has been outclassed by modern techniques such as Transformer based models and LLMs which have
much higher natural language processing capabilities. The cybersecurity field has hundreds of domain-specific terminology and acronyms that greatly impacted the original vectorization method.
Our research will test many different modern vectorizers to achieve greater accuracy and understaning of cybersecurity discussion online.
